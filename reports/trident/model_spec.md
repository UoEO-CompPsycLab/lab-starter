# Trident-G toy test — model spec (heavy-tailed updates under change-points)

## Aim (computational claim)
In a non-stationary tracking task with change-points, a Trident-style rule should show:
- **stability** during calm periods (small updates)
- **plasticity** after jumps (rare spikes)
- **heavy-tailed update magnitudes** |Δ|

## Task
Latent state θ_t with occasional change-points; observations:
y_t = θ_t + ε_t,  ε_t ~ N(0, σ²)

Data generated by:
- notebooks/03_trident_simulate.ipynb
Saved to:
- data/generated/trident/theta_timeseries.csv

## Candidate models
Baseline A: fixed learning-rate delta rule
- θ̂_{t+1} = θ̂_t + α (y_t − θ̂_t)

Baseline B (optional): adaptive step size α_t = clip(k|PE_t|, 0, α_max)

Trident toy learner: gated spikes + heavy-tailed step + cost shrink + small-update mode
- PE_t = y_t − θ̂_t
- p_spike = sigmoid(a(|PE_t| − b))
- if spike: m ~ Pareto(ν); m ← m/(1 + β_C m); θ̂_{t+1} = θ̂_t + sign(PE_t)·m
- else: θ̂_{t+1} = θ̂_t + α_small·PE_t

## Evaluation
- MSE over time (and mean MSE)
- Recovery time after change-points
- Update-magnitude distribution (log–log of |Δ|)
